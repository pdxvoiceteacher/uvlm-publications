# Recursive Spiral Coherence Operator

## Lean-Friendly Formalization Sketch

**Project:** CoherenceLattice / Sophia / UVLM  
**Context:** Triadic Brain Formalization  
**Purpose:** Provide theorem-oriented scaffolding for Lean formal verification of the recursive spiral coherence operator that governs knowledge evolution across the phase stack.

## 1. Motivation

The triadic brain architecture models knowledge evolution as a recursive dynamical process:

**corridor → river → terrace → orthodoxy → rupture → corridor**

This process corresponds mathematically to a bounded spiral attractor in a coherence phase space.

The system evolves by repeatedly applying three operators:

- Receptive operator (**R**)
- Structuring operator (**S**)
- Metabolic operator (**M**)

forming the recursive update rule:

\[
X_{n+1} = M \circ S \circ R (X_n)
\]

where \(X\) represents the current coherence state.

This document provides Lean-compatible scaffolding to formalize that recursion and prove key properties such as:

- boundedness
- regime classification
- terrace formation
- orthodoxy detection
- rupture and reopening
- recursive phase dynamics

The goal is not full nonlinear dynamical proofs initially, but a classification theory suitable for gradual Lean verification.

## 2. Mathematical State Representation

A coherence state captures the main invariants used across the architecture.

Example structure:

```lean
structure CoherenceState where
  E : ℝ        -- empathy / alignment signal
  T : ℝ        -- transparency / epistemic legibility
  ΔS : ℝ       -- entropy drift
  Λ : ℝ        -- criticality / instability
  Es : ℝ       -- ethical symmetry
  M : ℝ        -- memory continuity
  Igrad : ℝ    -- novelty gradient
  capture : ℝ  -- capture pressure
  instability : ℝ
```

Derived coherence metric:

\[
\psi = E \times T
\]

This scalar acts as the coherence magnitude of the system.

## 3. Recursive Operator System

The system evolves through three transformations.

### 3.1 Receptive Operator

Captures incoming novelty and social/environmental signals.

\[
R(X) = X\;\text{with}\;Igrad := Igrad + \alpha_R \cdot Igrad - \beta_R \cdot capture
\]

Effect:

- increases novelty gradient
- penalizes capture pressure

### 3.2 Structuring Operator

Organizes signals into emerging structure.

\[
S(X) = X\;\text{with}\;instability := instability + \alpha_S \cdot \psi - \beta_S \cdot instability
\]

Effect:

- coherence generates structure
- instability gradually dampens

### 3.3 Metabolic Operator

Represents system learning, memory, and entropy management.

\[
M(X) = X\;\text{with}\;\Lambda := \Lambda + \beta_M \cdot \Lambda,\;\Delta S := \Delta S - \alpha_M \cdot M - \gamma_M \cdot Es
\]

Effect:

- entropy reduction
- memory integration
- ethical symmetry stabilizes dynamics

### 3.4 Combined Update Rule

\[
step(X) = M(S(R(X)))
\]

Recursive evolution:

\[
X_{n+1} = step(X_n)
\]

## 4. Reduced Spiral Representation

For analysis, we reduce the state to two primary dimensions:

\[
Z = (\psi, K)
\]

where:

- \(\psi\) = coherence magnitude
- \(K\) = system criticality

The evolution resembles a spiral attractor:

\[
Z_{n+1} = \rho e^{i\theta} Z_n + \eta
\]

Expanded:

\[
\psi_{n+1} = \rho (\cos \theta \cdot \psi_n - \sin \theta \cdot K_n) + \eta_\psi
\]

\[
K_{n+1} = \rho (\sin \theta \cdot \psi_n + \cos \theta \cdot K_n) + \eta_K
\]

Interpretation:

| Parameter | Meaning |
|---|---|
| \(\rho\) | coherence amplification |
| \(\theta\) | structural rotation |
| \(\eta\) | stochastic perturbation |

## 5. Phase Classification Predicates

The recursive state can fall into several regimes.

### River Formation

\[
\rho > 1,\;\theta > 0
\]

Indicates accelerating cross-domain discovery.

### Terrace Formation

\[
\rho \ge 1,\;\theta \approx 0,\;\psi > \psi_c,\;\Lambda < \Lambda_c
\]

Meaning:

- coherence stabilizes
- criticality remains bounded
- knowledge becomes broadly legible

### False Orthodoxy

Occurs when coherence rises but structural health collapses.

Conditions include:

\[
\psi > \psi_c,\;Es < 0
\]

or

\[
\psi > \psi_c,\;\Lambda \ge \Lambda_c
\]

or

\[
\psi > \psi_c,\;Igrad \le 0
\]

Interpretation:

- novelty suppressed
- ethical symmetry inverted
- instability accumulating

### Rupture

\[
\Lambda \ge \Lambda_c
\]

or orthodoxy pressure \(\ge\) threshold.

Meaning: accumulated instability breaks the structure.

### Reopening Condition

\[
Igrad > 0,\;Es > 0,\;T > 0
\]

Meaning:

- novelty returns
- ethical symmetry restored
- transparency allows exploration

This generates new discovery corridors.

## 6. Recursive Spiral Phase Theorem (Conceptual)

The spiral operator yields one of the following regimes:

\[
RiverForming \lor TerraceForming \lor FalseOrthodoxy \lor Rupture
\]

The intended Lean theorem shape:

```lean
theorem recursive_step_yields_phase
  (X : CoherenceState) :
  RiverForming X ∨ TerraceForming X ∨ FalseOrthodoxy X ∨ Rupture X
```

Proof strategy:

- show bounded invariants
- prove threshold conditions
- classify state into regime sets

## 7. Terrace Stability Theorem

Terraces form under sustained coherence and bounded criticality.

Condition:

\[
\psi > \psi_c,\;\Lambda < \Lambda_c,\;\theta \to 0
\]

Meaning:

- discovery stabilizes
- knowledge becomes widely transmissible

## 8. Orthodoxy Anti-Signature

False terraces exhibit a characteristic pattern:

- \(\psi\) high
- \(Es\) negative
- \(Igrad\) suppressed
- \(\Lambda\) increasing

This corresponds to captured intellectual structures.

## 9. Rupture and Reopening

Collapse occurs when:

\[
\Lambda \ge \Lambda_c
\]

After rupture:

\[
Igrad > 0,\;Es > 0,\;T > 0
\]

produces plural experimentation.

This is the birth condition for new discovery corridors.

## 10. Cosmological Interpretation

The full knowledge evolution cycle becomes:

**rupture → corridor → braid → river → terrace → orthodoxy → rupture**

This is mathematically equivalent to a logarithmic spiral attractor with intermittent bifurcation events.

Thus knowledge evolution follows the same geometry as:

- turbulent fluid flows
- ecological niche formation
- galaxy spiral arms
- renormalization group trajectories

## 11. Implementation Strategy for Lean

Recommended proof order:

### Step 1

Prove scalar invariants:

\[
\psi \ge 0,\;\psi \le 1
\]

### Step 2

Prove operator admissibility:

\[
admissible(X) \to admissible(step(X))
\]

### Step 3

Define regime predicates:

- `RiverForming`
- `TerraceForming`
- `FalseOrthodoxy`
- `Rupture`

### Step 4

Prove local classification lemmas.

### Step 5

Construct recursive classification theorem.

## 13. Boundary Statement

The Recursive Spiral Coherence Operator:

- describes epistemic dynamics,
- classifies structural regimes,
- preserves plurality and anti-capture safeguards,
- but does **not** authorize governance action, canon closure, or authority claims.

All outputs remain diagnostic and advisory.

## 14. Conceptual Summary

The triadic architecture reveals that knowledge evolution is not linear.

It is spiral.

Discovery corridors braid into rivers.  
Rivers stabilize into terraces.  
Terraces risk hardening into orthodoxy.  
Orthodoxy ruptures under accumulated entropy.  
Rupture reopens the lattice.

And the spiral begins again.
