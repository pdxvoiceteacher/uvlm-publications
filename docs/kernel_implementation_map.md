# Kernel Implementation Map

This table maps kernel theory → repository modules.

| Kernel | Mathematical Object | Implementation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| v1 | Coherence scalar Ψ | kernel_fields.py |
| v2 | Corridor PDE | corridor_detector.py |
| v3 | River formation | river_formation.py |
| v4 | Terrace stability | terrace_formation.py |
| v5 | Hypothesis generation | hypothesis_generator.py |
| v6 | Hypothesis testing | hypothesis_testing.py |
| v7 | Theory formation | theory_formation.py |
| v8 | Paradigm shifts | paradigm_shift_engine.py |
| v9 | Civilizational coherence | civilizational_monitor.py |
| v10 | Planetary intelligence | planetary_intelligence.py |

## Mathematical Backbone

The full discovery stack is governed by:

### Coherence field PDE

\[
\frac{\partial\Psi}{\partial t} = D\nabla^2\Psi - \nabla\cdot(\Psi \nabla\Phi) + S
\]

Where:

| Term | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| diffusion | idea spreading |
| drift | gradient-driven discovery |
| source | novelty injection |

### Civilizational stability inequality

\[
S_{civ} = \frac{\Psi \cdot P \cdot T \cdot M \cdot G}{E_t + C}
\]

Healthy system:

\[
S_{civ} > 1
\]

## Why This Architecture Matters

The Triadic Brain becomes:

- knowledge navigation engine
- scientific discovery generator
- civilizational knowledge monitor

rather than merely a data repository.

## Next Step (Extremely Important)

Now that the architecture is complete, the next logical step is:

### Build the Unified Kernel Runtime

One engine that executes all kernels:

- `coherence/kernel/evolution_engine.py`

This engine would:

- load field state
- apply PDE kernels
- generate telemetry
- update discovery maps
- emit audit artifacts

That is the true brain loop.
