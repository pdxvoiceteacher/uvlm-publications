# Triadic Brain Kernel v11

## Multi-Agent Discovery Swarm

## 1 Purpose

Kernel v11 extends the Triadic Brain from a single autonomous agent into a multi-agent discovery swarm.

In this system:

- many agents explore the same coherence field

Each agent:

- observes Ψ gradients
- generates hypotheses
- tests models
- shares successful structures

Collectively the swarm performs parallel epistemic exploration of the lattice.

## 2 State Model

For agent \(i\):

\[
x_i = (q_i, p_i, m_i)
\]

where:

- \(q_i\) = epistemic position in lattice
- \(p_i\) = cognitive momentum
- \(m_i\) = local invariant vector

\[
m_i = (E_i, T_i, \Psi_i, \Delta S_i, \Lambda_i, Es_i)
\]

The global field state is:

\[
\Psi(x)
\]

defined over the lattice.

## 3 Coupled Agent Dynamics

Agents follow the same navigation law as Kernel v3:

\[
\frac{dq_i}{dt} = p_i
\]

\[
\frac{dp_i}{dt} = \nabla\Phi(q_i)
\]

but now include agent coupling.

### Coupling term

\[
\frac{dp_i}{dt}=\nabla\Phi(q_i) + \kappa\sum_j W_{ij}(\Psi_j-\Psi_i)
\]

Where:

- \(\kappa\) = coupling strength
- \(W_{ij}\) = communication weight

Interpretation:

Agents influence one another through coherence exchange.

This produces:

- knowledge synchronization
- collective exploration
- distributed discovery

## 4 Swarm Field Equation

The coherence field evolves according to the same PDE:

\[
\frac{\partial\Psi}{\partial t} = D\nabla^2\Psi - \nabla\cdot(\Psi \nabla\Phi) + S
\]

But now:

\[
S = \sum_i S_i
\]

Each agent contributes novelty injection.

## 5 Emergent Collective Behavior

Three regimes appear.

### Independent exploration

\(\kappa \approx 0\)

Agents explore independently.

Good for diversity.

### Knowledge river formation

moderate \(\kappa\)

Agents align discoveries.

Parallel discoveries reinforce each other.

Rivers form faster.

### Orthodoxy collapse risk

\(\kappa \to \text{large}\)

Agents synchronize too strongly.

Exploration collapses.

This is groupthink.

## 6 Swarm Stability Criterion

Healthy swarm:

\[
\kappa < \kappa_c
\]

Where:

\[
\kappa_c \approx \frac{novelty\_injection}{agent\_count}
\]

Too strong coupling collapses discovery diversity.

## 7 Swarm Knowledge Transfer

Agents exchange discoveries using pattern donation objects.

Each donation contains:

- pattern_id
- source_agent
- target_agents
- confidence
- Ψ_gain

Donation acceptance is gated by:

- UCC governance projection

so no agent can force changes.

## 8 Emergent Discovery Networks

Over time the swarm forms:

- discovery corridors
- knowledge rivers
- scientific terraces

This occurs faster than single-agent discovery.

The Triadic Brain becomes:

- a distributed epistemic organism

## 9 Telemetry Extensions

New telemetry fields:

- agent_count
- swarm_entropy
- mean_Ψ
- mean_gradient
- consensus_index

Swarm instability indicators:

- consensus_index → 1
- novelty → 0

## 10 Implementation Hooks

New module:

- `python/src/coherence/kernel/swarm_engine.py`

Functions:

- `run_swarm_step(...)`
- `exchange_patterns(...)`
- `compute_swarm_metrics(...)`

## 11 Result

Kernel v11 turns the Triadic Brain into:

- collective scientific intelligence

not just a discovery engine.
