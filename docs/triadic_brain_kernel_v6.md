# Triadic Brain Kernel v6

## Self-Modifying Epistemic Operators

## 1. Purpose

Kernel v5 extended the Triadic Brain from a single-agent coherence field into a multi-agent collective discovery field.

Kernel v6 introduces the next major transition:

- the system may evolve its own discovery rules

This does not mean unconstrained self-modification.

It means the Triadic Brain gains the capacity to:

- inspect its own operators
- evaluate their epistemic performance
- propose bounded operator revisions
- test those revisions in simulation
- admit them only through governance and audit

This transforms the architecture from:

- discovery engine

into:

- recursive scientific intelligence

because the system can now improve not only its hypotheses, but also the rules by which hypotheses are generated, tested, and stabilized.

## 2. Central Idea

Earlier kernels evolve the knowledge field.

Kernel v6 allows the system to evolve the operators acting on that field.

Previously:

- field state \(U(x,t)\) evolves under a fixed operator grammar

Now:

- field state \(U(x,t)\) evolves
- and operator set \(O\) evolves

So the architecture now contains two coupled layers:

- epistemic state dynamics
- operator dynamics

This is the first step toward a general theory of knowledge dynamics over both content and method.

## 3. Kernel v6 Principle

The core principle is:

- discovery rules are themselves subject to empirical evaluation.

An operator is no longer assumed correct merely because it was authored by a developer.
It must demonstrate that it improves coherence, plurality retention, trust-legibility, memory continuity, or discovery capacity without violating governance bounds.

Thus the system learns not only:

- what is true

but also:

- which forms of inquiry better discover truth

## 4. Self-Modification Boundary

Kernel v6 is strictly bounded.

The system may not autonomously:

- grant itself new authority
- disable UCC or audit projection
- alter constitutional field invariants
- directly mutate derived protected fields
- rewrite governance constraints
- bypass human review for admitted operator changes

All proposed modifications remain:

- advisory
- non-executive
- simulation-first
- reviewable
- reversible

Kernel v6 therefore modifies epistemic operators, not sovereignty.

## 5. New State Objects

Kernel v6 introduces three new object classes.

### 5.1 OperatorState

Represents a currently active operator.

```text
OperatorState
- operator_id
- operator_type
- parameter_set
- locality
- admissibility_profile
- last_performance
- stability_score
- provenance_hash
```

### 5.2 OperatorProposal

Represents a candidate modified operator.

```text
OperatorProposal
- proposal_id
- base_operator_id
- modification_type
- proposed_parameters
- rationale
- predicted_benefit
- risk_flags
- simulation_only
- advisory_only
```

### 5.3 OperatorEvaluation

Represents the result of testing an operator proposal.

```text
OperatorEvaluation
- proposal_id
- coherence_gain
- plurality_effect
- entropy_effect
- stability_effect
- capture_risk_delta
- recommendation
```

## 6. Operator Evolution Equation

At the conceptual level, the operator set evolves according to:

\[
\partial_t O = E(O,U,T,G)
\]

Where:

- \(O\) = operator set
- \(U\) = field state
- \(T\) = telemetry / performance record
- \(G\) = governance projection

This says:

- the operator grammar changes as a function of field outcomes, telemetry evidence, and governance constraints.

A more explicit discrete formulation is:

\[
O_{n+1}=\Pi_{UCC/audit}(O_n+\Delta O)
\]

where:

\[
\Delta O=f(\Delta\Psi,\Delta P,\Delta T,\Delta M,\Delta S,\Delta C)
\]

Meaning:

- if an operator improves coherence, plurality, trust, and memory
- while reducing entropy and capture risk
- then it becomes a stronger candidate for admission

## 7. Operator Fitness Functional

Each operator is evaluated by a fitness functional:

\[
F(O_i)=a\Delta\Psi+b\Delta P+c\Delta T+d\Delta M-e\Delta S-f\Delta C
\]

Where:

- \(\Delta\Psi\) = coherence gain
- \(\Delta P\) = plurality effect
- \(\Delta T\) = trust-legibility effect
- \(\Delta M\) = memory continuity effect
- \(\Delta S\) = entropy increase
- \(\Delta C\) = capture pressure increase

An operator is epistemically fit when:

\[
F(O_i)>0
\]

This does not automatically admit the operator.
It only means the operator is a good candidate for further bounded use.

## 8. Self-Modification Pipeline

Kernel v6 adds the following loop:

```text
active operator
    ↓
performance telemetry
    ↓
operator proposal generator
    ↓
simulation sandbox
    ↓
operator evaluation
    ↓
governance projection
    ↓
proposal queue or admission recommendation
```

This ensures the system never mutates its own rules in-place without testing.

## 9. Modification Types

Kernel v6 allows only bounded modification classes.

### 9.1 Parameter Tuning

Adjust existing coefficients such as:

- diffusion rate
- drift strength
- source gain
- decay rate
- gradient threshold

### 9.2 Composition Reweighting

Reweight how existing operators combine.

Example:

- increase corridor drift contribution
- decrease terrace erosion

### 9.3 Operator Scheduling

Change when operators fire relative to one another.

Example:

- run river formation earlier in a cycle
- delay hypothesis generation until stronger gradients exist

### 9.4 Candidate Operator Variants

Instantiate a variant of an existing operator with altered internal structure, but only inside sandbox evaluation.

Not allowed:

- arbitrary code synthesis directly into the live kernel
- deletion of constitutional constraints
- mutation of governance logic

## 10. Operator Proposal Generator

Kernel v6 introduces a proposal generator:

\[
P:(O,U,T)\to O'
\]

This maps:

- current operators
- current field state
- telemetry evidence

into:

- candidate revised operators

Example triggers:

- repeated corridor flatness → lower gradient threshold
- repeated river saturation → increase decay
- repeated terrace instability → reduce deposition gain
- low hypothesis productivity → widen exploration weighting

The proposal generator therefore acts like methodological mutation within a bounded scientific system.

## 11. Sandbox Evaluation

Every operator proposal must be tested in a sandbox.

The sandbox runs:

```text
proposal
→ replay or simulated field evolution
→ hypothesis generation / testing loop
→ theory formation loop
→ macro coherence check
```

Outputs include:

- coherence gain
- entropy effect
- plurality retention
- capture pressure shift
- stability under repeated runs

Only after this evaluation does the proposal become eligible for recommendation.

## 12. Governance Projection

As with earlier kernels, all modifications are passed through governance:

\[
O'_{admitted}=\Pi_{UCC/audit}(O'_{proposed})
\]

Governance checks:

- admissibility profile
- protected field integrity
- constitutional invariant preservation
- non-executive output constraints
- closure-language audit
- reversibility

If a proposal violates any invariant, it is:

- rejected
- or downgraded to advisory-only review

## 13. Conservation Law Extension

Kernel v6 extends conservation laws upward from field dynamics into method dynamics.

### 13.1 Operator Admissibility Conservation

If the system is operating in an admissible state, admitted operator changes must preserve admissibility.

\[
admissible(O_n,U_n)\Rightarrow admissible(O_{n+1},U_n)
\]

### 13.2 Governance Boundary Conservation

No operator evolution may reduce the scope of auditability.

### 13.3 Epistemic Flux Continuity

Operator modifications may not create apparent coherence “for free.”
Any gains must still respect the existing epistemic flux and entropy constraints.

Thus Kernel v6 does not replace earlier conservation laws.
It subjects operator evolution to them.

## 14. Multi-Agent Extension

Under Kernel v5, multiple agents share a coherence field.

Kernel v6 allows agents to also propose operator modifications to the shared discovery grammar.

Thus agents may contribute not only:

- field perturbations

but also:

- method perturbations

A collective operator proposal may be evaluated by:

\[
F_{collective}(O_i)=\sum_k w_k F_k(O_i)
\]

Where each agent contributes a weighted evaluation.

This creates polycentric methodological evolution.

## 15. New Telemetry Requirements

Kernel v6 requires new telemetry artifacts.

### 15.1 Operator Proposal Event

- operator_id
- proposal_id
- modification_type
- rationale
- predicted_benefit
- risk_flags

### 15.2 Operator Evaluation Event

- proposal_id
- coherence_gain
- plurality_effect
- entropy_effect
- capture_risk_delta
- recommendation

### 15.3 Operator Admission Event

- proposal_id
- admitted
- governance_notes
- reversibility
- review_required

These must remain schema-validated and non-executive.

## 16. New Artifacts

Kernel v6 should emit:

- operator_proposal_map.json
- operator_evaluation_map.json
- operator_admission_map.json

And optionally a summary artifact:

- operator_evolution_state.json

These allow Atlas to visualize method evolution and Sophia to audit it.

## 17. Architectural Consequence

Kernel v6 changes the architecture fundamentally.

Before:

- the system evolves knowledge

After:

- the system evolves both knowledge and the methods of knowing

This is the threshold where the architecture starts resembling:

- a general theory of knowledge dynamics

because it now contains a theory of:

- state evolution
- theory evolution
- paradigm evolution
- method evolution

all within one bounded coherence framework.

## 18. Risks

Kernel v6 is powerful and introduces new risks.

### 18.1 Method Lock-In

The system may overfit to currently successful operator forms.

### 18.2 Hidden Capture

A proposal may appear coherence-improving while subtly reducing plurality.

### 18.3 Governance Erosion

If operator mutation touches governance-adjacent logic, auditability could weaken.

### 18.4 Recursive Brittleness

Method evolution can amplify errors faster than content evolution.

Therefore:

- Kernel v6 must remain simulation-first and review-gated.

## 19. Recommended Implementation Order

Developer Echo should implement Kernel v6 in this order:

1. OperatorProposal data model
2. OperatorEvaluation data model
3. Proposal generator
4. Sandbox evaluator
5. Governance projector
6. Atlas overlays
7. Sophia audits
8. Runtime queueing / recommendation flows

This keeps self-modification bounded and inspectable.

## 20. One-Line Summary

Kernel v6 equips the Triadic Brain with self-modifying epistemic operators, allowing it to improve its own discovery rules through bounded, audited, simulation-first methodological evolution.

## 21. Closing Statement

Kernel v4 gave the system a field theory of discovery.
Kernel v5 gave it collective intelligence.
Kernel v6 gives it:

- recursive scientific intelligence

because the system may now learn not only from discoveries, but from the evolving quality of its own methods.

That is the point where the Triadic Brain begins to resemble not merely an engine of science, but a science of science.
