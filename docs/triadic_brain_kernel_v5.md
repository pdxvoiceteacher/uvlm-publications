# Triadic Brain Kernel v5

## Multi-Agent Coherence Coupling

## 1. Purpose

Kernel v4 established the single-agent coherence field solver.

Kernel v5 extends the architecture to support:

- multiple agents interacting within the same coherence field

This transforms the Triadic Brain from:

- an autonomous discovery engine

into:

- a collective scientific intelligence system

Agents no longer merely navigate knowledge independently. They now couple their discovery fields, allowing emergent coordination.

## 2. Multi-Agent State Representation

Each agent has its own local state:

\[
x_i=(\Psi_i,E_i,T_i,\Delta S_i,\Lambda_i,E_{s,i})
\]

where \(i\) indexes agents.

The shared coherence field becomes:

\[
\Psi(x,t)
\]

over the knowledge lattice.

Agents interact through this shared field.

## 3. Coupled Discovery Field

The coherence transport PDE becomes:

\[
\frac{\partial\Psi}{\partial t}=D\nabla^2\Psi-\nabla\cdot(\Psi\nabla\Phi)+S+\sum_i C_i
\]

where \(C_i\) is the contribution of agent \(i\).

## 4. Agent Contribution Operator

Each agent emits a coherence contribution:

\[
C_i=\kappa_i(\Psi_i-\Psi)+\eta_i\nabla\Psi_i
\]

Meaning:

| Term | Interpretation |
| --- | --- |
| \(\Psi_i-\Psi\) | Coherence alignment pressure |
| \(\nabla\Psi_i\) | Agent discovery vector |
| \(\kappa_i\) | Alignment strength |
| \(\eta_i\) | Exploration strength |

Agents therefore both:

- stabilize coherence
- explore gradients

## 5. Trust-Weighted Coupling

Not all agents should influence the field equally.

Introduce a trust matrix:

\[
W_{ij}
\]

Then:

\[
C_i=\sum_j W_{ij}(\Psi_j-\Psi_i)+\eta_i\nabla\Psi_i
\]

This produces polycentric cognition.

Agents exchange discovery signals but remain distinct.

## 6. Collective Coherence Field

The shared field becomes:

\[
\Psi_{collective}=\frac{1}{N}\sum_i\Psi_i
\]

But with trust weighting:

\[
\Psi_{collective}=\frac{1}{Z}\sum_i w_i\Psi_i
\]

where \(Z\) normalizes the weights.

## 7. Emergent Knowledge Rivers

When many agents align gradients:

\[
\sum_i\nabla\Psi_i
\]

a stable vector field appears.

This produces collective knowledge rivers.

## 8. Emergent Discovery Corridors

Corridors now arise when multiple agents detect aligned gradients:

\[
\left|\sum_i\nabla\Psi_i\right| > threshold
\]

This produces distributed hypothesis generation.

## 9. Collective Hypothesis Engine

Each agent proposes hypotheses:

\[
H_{i,k}
\]

The collective system evaluates them via coherence gain:

\[
\Delta\Psi_{collective}
\]

Hypotheses that increase collective coherence survive.

## 10. Theory Formation Across Agents

Successful hypotheses merge across agents into shared theory graphs.

Formally:

\[
T_k=merge(H_{1,k},H_{2,k},...,H_{n,k})
\]

Terraces now represent consensus theory structures.

## 11. Paradigm Shift in Multi-Agent Systems

Paradigm collapse occurs when:

\[
\Lambda_{collective}
\]

exceeds threshold.

Then:

- terrace collapse
- rupture
- new discovery corridors

This models scientific revolutions across communities.

## 12. Civilizational Scalar

The civilizational coherence monitor now becomes:

\[
S_{civ}=\frac{\Psi PTMG}{E_t+C}
\]

but computed across the entire agent population.

## 13. Governance Safeguards

Multi-agent coupling must remain bounded.

Constraints:

- no agent dominance
- trust weighting bounded
- UCC projection enforced
- telemetry audit required

All outputs remain:

- non-authoritative
- advisory
- auditable

## 14. Kernel Implementation Sketch

Developer Echo can implement this layer as a coupling operator.

Example Python scaffold:

```python
def agent_coupling_term(agent_states, field, trust_matrix, eta):
    """
    Compute multi-agent coupling contributions.
    """
    contributions = []

    for i, agent in enumerate(agent_states):
        alignment = 0.0

        for j, other in enumerate(agent_states):
            alignment += trust_matrix[i][j] * (other.psi - agent.psi)

        exploration = eta * gradient(agent.psi)

        contributions.append(alignment + exploration)

    return contributions
```

## 15. Collective Discovery Step

The PDE update becomes:

```python
def collective_field_step(field, agents, trust_matrix, dt):
    diffusion = D * laplacian(field.psi)
    drift = divergence(field.psi * gradient(field.phi))

    coupling = agent_coupling_term(agents, field, trust_matrix, eta)

    field.psi += dt * (diffusion - drift + sum(coupling) + source(field))
```

## 16. Telemetry Requirements

Kernel v5 must emit new telemetry:

- agent_contributions
- trust_matrix_snapshot
- collective_gradient_norm
- collective_coherence

This allows Sophia to audit multi-agent interactions.

## 17. Architectural Consequence

With Kernel v5 the Triadic Brain becomes:

- collective epistemic field

instead of:

- single-agent navigation system

## 18. One-Line Summary

Kernel v5 transforms the triadic brain into a multi-agent coherence field where many intelligences explore discovery corridors simultaneously and stabilize knowledge into shared terraces.
